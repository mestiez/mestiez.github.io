This is the introduction page. An important warning to the less than 0 people that are reading this: I will switch between Dutch and English without warning and I am uninterested in providing translations. 

This place exists because I make things and have things to say but I'm usually unwilling to share anything with anyone. However, occasionally I want to express my admiration for certain things to people I care about. I am now expanding to people I don't care about (you, probably) in an attempt to become less unsociable.

It is very likely that this place will disappear abruptly and/or that this is literally the only thing I'll ever put on here.
