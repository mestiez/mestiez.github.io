I have a Discord server to share my work and gather indirect feedback, which is valuable to me. Obviously this means I deal with online people a lot. Most of them are completely normal people. Some of them, the loudest ones, are **terminally online**. It _seems_ like they have detached from reality and care about the events on a Discord server more than they care about events in the real world. That's fine. However, these people tend to project their unreasonable concern for the online world onto everyone else. 

I'm writing this cute little article to express to absolutely nobody that I seriously do not care as much as it may seem. These online platforms are nothing to me other than a place to gather feedback and share progress. 99.99% of what I do there is not personal nor significant. I'm not interested. Be nice to each other!!!
